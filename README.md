# Arecibo Grid Tools

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Arecibo Grid Tools**. Inspired by the iconic [Arecibo Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) of 1974, which was specially designed to communicate with extra-terrestrial life, this repository hosts some web tools designed for those interested in exploring and recreating Arecibo grids or binary sequences. This repository contains two main tools:

1. **Arecibo Grid Generator Tool**
2. **Arecibo Grid Drawer Tool**

## Arecibo Generator Tool

The **Arecibo Grid Generator** allows users to input binary sequences and generate Arecibo-style grids. It also has options for greyscale inputs, autofill for the 1974 Arecibo Message or the 2001 Arecibo Answer, and customizable grid settings.

## Arecibo Drawer Tool

The **Arecibo Grid Drawer** lets users create binary strings based on grid designs. Users can load Arecibo grid images as templates, adjust grid dimensions, and generate custom binary sequences.
